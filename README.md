ABSTRACT:
Sentiment analysis of customer reviews has a crucial impact on a business’s development strategy. Evolution of
the internet in the past decade resulted in generation of voluminous data in all sectors. Due to these advents,
the people have new ways of expressing their opinions about anything in the form of Google Reviews, Tweets,

opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer’s attitude toward a
particular topic is positive, negative or neutral. Knowing the opinion of customers is very important for any
business.
Hence, in this we analyze the reviews given by the customers of the restaurant with help of machine
learning classification algorithms. The Modern area of sentiment mining also called opinion mining .Researcher
in the area of natural language processing(NLP), data mining, machine learning, Support Vector Machine(SVM)
and test the method of sentiment analysis process. This problem can be addressed by an automated system
called sentiment analysis and opinion mining that can analyze and extract the users view in the reviews.

CONCLUSION:
This present a study of important techniques to identify sentiment analysis of reviews. In this
major approaches applicable to identify the sentiment analysis of review text to be analyzed. We cover the
maximum out of all existing techniques and also do the comparison of these techniques and use nlp for
tokenization, remove stopwords and punctuation marks are also do stemming. And use a supervised machine
learning algorithm which is linear regression and naïve multinomial algorithm for classification.
